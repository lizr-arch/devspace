# Security Model

DevSpace exposes local coding capabilities over MCP. Treat it as remote access
to your development machine.

The security model is simple:

- you choose a narrow filesystem allowlist
- the MCP endpoint requires OAuth approval with your Owner password
- Host headers are allowlisted from the configured public URL
- every coding action happens through explicit MCP tool calls

## Filesystem Allowlist

DevSpace only opens workspaces under configured roots.

Good examples:

```text
~/work
~/personal/open-source
```

Avoid broad roots:

```text
~
/
C:\
```

The narrower the root, the easier it is to reason about what the MCP client can
reach.

## Owner Password

`devspace init` generates an Owner password and stores it in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

When an MCP client connects, DevSpace shows an approval page. Enter the Owner
password only when you intentionally want that client to access this server.

For env-driven deployments, set a long random value:

```bash
DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

## Public URL And Host Allowlist

DevSpace needs `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so MCP clients can discover OAuth
metadata and connect to the correct resource.

The value should be the origin only:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Do not include `/mcp` in `DEVSPACE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

By default, DevSpace derives allowed Host headers from the local host and public
URL. Use `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*` only for intentional local debugging.

## Tunnels

DevSpace does not manage tunnels. Your tunnel or reverse proxy should point to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676
```

Prefer adding Cloudflare Access, Tailscale identity controls, or equivalent
protection in front of public tunnels. DevSpace OAuth still protects the MCP
endpoint, but the tunnel URL should not be treated as a secret.

## Shell Access

The shell tool is powerful by design. It is meant for tests, builds, git, and
package scripts.

Filesystem path containment applies to DevSpace file tools. Shell commands run
as local commands and can do what your user account can do. This is why the MCP
client must be trusted and the Owner password must stay private.

## Project Memory SHADOW Boundary

Project Memory commands come only from the operator's DevSpace configuration.
DevSpace does not execute a command declared by the opened repository. A mapping
must use an exact trusted repository root and the fixed command
`rtk proxy py -3.11 scripts/manage_project_memory.py`.

The current task is sent to that command over stdin and may appear in the
one-time bounded bundle returned to the MCP client. DevSpace does not store the
raw task or bundle. SQLite stores the task SHA-256, validated receipt, active
decision, sanitized denial codes, bundle-delivery timestamp, access events, and
one-time privilege authorization state. Receipt validation rejects malformed
bindings, unsafe owner paths, task-hash mismatches, and bundle-hash mismatches.

This release is SHADOW-only. Missing, expired, mismatched, or would-deny receipts
produce audit observations but do not block existing tools, including raw shell
access. NORMAL, AUDIT, and UPDATE enforcement are not enabled by this
configuration. Project Memory constrains only DevSpace's MCP tool layer; it is
not a sandbox for other local processes or direct filesystem access.

## Worktrees

Managed worktrees reduce accidental edits to your active checkout, but they are
not a security boundary. They are a workflow boundary for isolated coding
sessions.

## Logs

By default, DevSpace logs requests and tool calls. Shell command previews are
disabled unless `DEVSPACE_LOG_SHELL_COMMANDS=1`.

Do not enable shell command logging if commands may contain secrets.
